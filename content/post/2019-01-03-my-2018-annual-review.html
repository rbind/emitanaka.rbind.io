<h2>#rstats goals</h2>
<p>I love reading the many #rstats goals that people have posted on twitter. As 2019 commenced, in no time, Jason Baik presented the analysis of these tweet</p>

<p>and <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2019/01/01/r-goals/">MaÃ«lle Salmon wrote a blogpost on it</a>. Here is a bar/lollipop graph that MaÃ«lle produced on the most mentioned topics:</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think all mention of <code>package</code> here would refer to learning how to build an R package but Steph de Silva has come up with a lovely initiative with a lot of people happy to help you develop your R package so itâ€™s a good year perhaps to get started if you have not build an R package before!</p>

<p>One of the other top mentions was <code>blog</code> so it seems that either people want commit more to blogging, or if not that reading blogs :P</p>
<p>For my own goals, I certainly hope to blog more and help alleviate my anxiety in writing. Yes I do have those anxiety and it multiplies when I put my writing out in public. I get in particular self-conscious and perfectionist tendancies befall me. I donâ€™t really take these emotions all negatively though as it pushes me to do better when I constantly question how I can improve my writing. At the same time I try not to get consumed in being perfect and debilitate me from writing. So hereâ€™s my start to the year to what I hope will be more writing!</p>

<h2>2018 in review</h2>
<p>2018 has been a busy but overall an amazing year for me. I donâ€™t intend to write down everything at this moment as I have other things that I need to get done first but I also donâ€™t want to delay for too long to write when the new year just started!</p>
<p>If I were to mention one thing that was amazing, it was getting more acquainted with the R community. I got to know a lot of wonderful people around the world who generously share their knowledge and tips via twitter. I know some of these people in real life; some I met for the first time this year and some I have yet to meet. Itâ€™s exciting to know that when I travel, Iâ€™ll have a chance to meet these people.</p>
<p>While overall 2018 has been a great year, it doesnâ€™t mean everything that happened in 2018 has been good to me. One particular incident towards the end of the year stuck out as a sore thumb to me. I was upset. What followed was amazing though.</p>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1069591090674786305">Mara started a #rstats version of #devAdvent</a> starting off with me. Needless to say it made me happy :)</li>

<li><p>A special topics session organised by Tamanna got accepted for ISI World Statistics Congress. This means that I will be speaking on the same stage with IBS President Louise Ryan and ISI President-elect John Bailer at ISI WSC 2019 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p></li>
<li><p>In the week after that I got two invitations to present in 2019. I accepted both but Iâ€™m omitting any detail before any public announcment by the organisers.</p></li>
<li><p>The week after that I got notice on my success for grant funding where I was the lead. There was also another grant but I was not the lead for that one. Again Iâ€™m omitting detail here until itâ€™s publicly announced.</p></li>
<li><p>I got asked to be in two projects. I commited 0.2 FTE on one and 0.15 FTE on the other. If it is funded then it means that Iâ€™ll have postdoc(s) or PhD student(s) to work with.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This all happened in a short span of time after I was quite upset. The way I feel is that the community somehow knew I was upset and all tried to make feel better. I know; what a hopeless romantic I am ðŸ˜…
Nonetheless, I feel lucky to be part of the R community and hope that I can contribute more in 2019.</p>
